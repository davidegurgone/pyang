#summary Validation of XML instances.

= Introduction =

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6110 RFC 6110] defines a mapping from YANG to standard [http://www.dsdl.org DSDL] schemas. Pyang's _dsdl_ plugin, together with several XSLT stylesheet that are also part of pyang distribution, fully implements the mapping procedure. The generated DSDL schemas can be used with generic off-the-shelf XML tools for both syntactic and semantic validation of XML instance documents.

This page explains the use of a shell script, _yang2dsdl_, which is also provided as a simple front end to the validation procedure. Developers that need more control should read about the hairy details in DSDLTechDetails.

= DSDL Schemas =

Let's apply the _yang2dsdl_ script to our data model, [TuringMachine turing-machine.yang], and generate a coordinated set of DSDL schemas:

{{{
$ yang2dsdl -t config turing-machine.yang
== Generating RELAX NG schema './turing-machine-config.rng'
Done.

== Generating Schematron schema './turing-machine-config.sch'
Done.

== Generating DSRL schema './turing-machine-config.dsrl'
Done.
}}}

As we can see from the output, three schemas are generated:

 * _RELAX NG_ schema (`turing-machine-config.rng`) describes the structure of the instance document (its grammar), and datatypes of leaf data nodes.

 * _Schematron_ schema (`turing-machine-config.sch`) represents semantic rules defined in the YANG data model.

 * _DSRL_ schema (`turing-machine-config.dsrl`) contains instructions that can be used for extending an instance XML document with default values.

The careful reader will notice that the script also created a fourth file, `turing-machine-gdefs-config.rng`, which is a part of the RELAX NG schema. 

The command-line option `-t` of _yang2dsdl_ defines the _target_ for the schemas. In this case, we instruct the script to generate schemas for the contents of a _configuration datastore_, i.e. configuration data only. Supported targets are:

<dl>
   <dt>data</dt>
   <dd>datastore contents (configuration and state
     data) encapsulated in `<nc:data>` document element;</dd>
</dl>
