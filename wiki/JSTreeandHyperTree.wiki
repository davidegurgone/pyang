#summary pyang plugin to generate  JavaScript and Hyperbolic tree navigators from YANG

= Introduction =

The pyang -f tree generates an ASCII based tree representation that is great for navigating the model.
There are two new (soon to be released) tree representations
  * Javascript tree: `pyang -f jstree`
  * Hyperbolic tree: `pyang - f hypertree`

== Javascript Tree ==
The Javascript tree output creates a html/javascript page with the model:

You can try it [http://code.google.com/p/pyang/wiki/ietf-netconf-acm] on the YANG module for access control [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6536 RFC6536]


== Hyperbolic Tree ==
For very large models a traditional tree can be hard to navigate. A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_tree hyperbolic tree] can help.
Personally I am not convinced if a get help or get dizzy.
The hyperbolic output generates an xml file that can be displayed in [http://treebolic.sourceforge.net/ Treebolic]:
